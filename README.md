# adversarial-search-using-alpha-beta-pruning-PAC-Man

It is implementation of adversarial search using alpha-beta pruning on top of a PAC-Man game. I used an implementation of Pac-Man projects developed at UC-Berkeley for the introductory AI course. In addition, I used implemented codes in some parts of my project, I referenced them inside the code. 
Note: Python 2.7.2(Jun 12 2011) has been used to implement new parts.
